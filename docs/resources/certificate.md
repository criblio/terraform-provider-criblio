```terraform
import {
  to = criblio_certificate.my_criblio_certificate
  id = "cert-001"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import criblio_certificate.my_criblio_certificate "cert-001"
```
