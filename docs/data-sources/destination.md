- `flush_period_sec` (Number) Maximum time between requests. Small values could cause the payload size to be smaller than the configured Maximum time between requests. Small values can reduce the payload size below the configured 'Max record size' and 'Max events per request'. Warning: Setting this too low can increase the number of ongoing requests (depending on the value of 'Request concurrency'); this can cause Loki and Prometheus to complain about entries being delivered out of order.
- `id` (String) Unique ID for this output
- `labels` (Attributes List) List of labels to send with logs. Labels define Loki streams, so use static labels to avoid proliferating label value combinations and streams. Can be merged and/or overridden by the event's __labels field (e.g.: '__labels: {host: "cribl.io", level: "error"}'). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--output_grafana_cloud--output_grafana_cloud_grafana_cloud2--labels))

- `max_payload_size_kb` (Number) Maximum size, in KB, of the request body. Warning: Setting this too low can increase the number of ongoing requests (depending on the value of 'Request concurrency'); this can cause Loki and Prometheus to complain about entries being delivered out of order.
- `message` (String) Name of the event field that contains the message to send. If not specified, Stream sends a JSON representation of the whole event.
- `message_format` (String) Which format to use when sending logs to Loki (Protobuf or JSON).  Defaults to Protobuf.
- `metric_rename_expr` (String) A JS expression that can be used to rename metrics. E.g.: name.replace(/\./g, '_') will replace all '.' characters in a metric's name with the supported '_' character.

In Always On mode, PQ always writes events to the filesystem.
- `pq_on_backpressure` (String) Whether to block or drop events when the queue is exerting backpressure (full capacity or low disk). 'Block' is the same behavior as non-PQ blocking. 'Drop new data' throws away incoming data, while leaving the contents of the PQ unchanged.
- `pq_path` (String) The location for the persistent queue files. To this field's value, the system will append: /<worker-id>/<output-id>.

### Nested Schema for `output_xsiam`

Read-Only:

- `auth_type` (String) Enter a token directly, or provide a secret referencing a token
- `compress` (Boolean) Compress the payload body before sending
- `concurrency` (Number) Maximum number of ongoing requests before blocking
- `description` (String)
- `dns_resolve_period_sec` (Number) Re-resolve any hostnames every this many seconds and pick up destinations from A records.
- `environment` (String) Optionally, enable this config only on a specified Git branch. If empty, will be enabled everywhere.
- `exclude_self` (Boolean) Exclude all IPs of the current host from the list of any resolved hostnames.
- `extra_http_headers` (Attributes List) Headers to add to all events. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--output_xsiam--extra_http_headers))
- `failed_request_logging_mode` (String) Data to log when a request fails. All headers are redacted by default, unless listed as safe headers below.
- `flush_period_sec` (Number) Maximum time between requests. Small values could cause the payload size to be smaller than the configured Max body size.
- `id` (String) Unique ID for this output
- `load_balance_stats_period_sec` (Number) How far back in time to keep traffic stats for load balancing purposes.
- `load_balanced` (Boolean) Enable for optimal performance. Even if you have one hostname, it can expand to multiple IPs. If disabled, consider enabling round-robin DNS.
- `max_payload_events` (Number) Maximum number of events to include in the request body. Default is 0 (unlimited).
- `on_backpressure` (String) Whether to block, drop, or queue events when all receivers are exerting backpressure.
- `pipeline` (String) Pipeline to process data before sending out to this output
- `pq_compress` (String) Codec to use to compress the persisted data.
- `pq_controls` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--output_xsiam--pq_controls))
- `pq_max_file_size` (String) The maximum size to store in each queue file before closing and optionally compressing (KB, MB, etc.).
- `pq_max_size` (String) The maximum disk space that the queue can consume (as an average per Worker Process) before queueing stops. Enter a numeral with units of KB, MB, etc.
- `pq_mode` (String) In Error mode, PQ writes events to the filesystem only when it detects a non-retryable Destination error. In Backpressure mode, PQ writes events to the filesystem when it detects backpressure from the Destination or when there are non-retryable Destination errors. In Always On mode, PQ always writes events to the filesystem.
- `pq_on_backpressure` (String) Whether to block or drop events when the queue is exerting backpressure (full capacity or low disk). 'Block' is the same behavior as non-PQ blocking. 'Drop new data' throws away incoming data, while leaving the contents of the PQ unchanged.
- `pq_path` (String) The location for the persistent queue files. To this field's value, the system will append: /<worker-id>/<output-id>.
- `reject_unauthorized` (Boolean) Reject certificates not authorized by a CA in the CA certificate path or by another trusted CA (such as the system's). 
        Defaults to Yes. When this setting is also present in TLS Settings (Client Side), 
        that value will take precedence.
- `response_honor_retry_after_header` (Boolean) Honor any Retry-After header that specifies a delay (in seconds) no longer than 180 seconds after the retry request. @{product} limits the delay to 180 seconds, even if the Retry-After header specifies a longer delay. When enabled, takes precedence over user-configured retry options. When disabled, all Retry-After headers are ignored.
- `response_retry_settings` (Attributes List) Automatically retry after unsuccessful response status codes, such as 429 (Too Many Requests) or 503 (Service Unavailable). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--output_xsiam--response_retry_settings))
- `safe_headers` (List of String) List of headers that are safe to log in plain text
- `status` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--output_xsiam--status))
- `streamtags` (List of String) Tags for filtering and grouping in @{product}
- `system_fields` (List of String) Fields to automatically add to events, such as cribl_pipe. Supports wildcards.
- `text_secret` (String) Select or create a stored text secret
- `throttle_rate_req_per_sec` (Number) Maximum number of requests to limit to per second
- `timeout_retry_settings` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--output_xsiam--timeout_retry_settings))
- `timeout_sec` (Number) Amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a request to complete before canceling it
- `token` (String) XSIAM authentication token
- `type` (String)
- `url` (String) XSIAM endpoint URL to send events to, such as https://api-{tenant external URL}/logs/v1/event
- `urls` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--output_xsiam--urls))
- `use_round_robin_dns` (Boolean) Enables round-robin DNS lookup. When a DNS server returns multiple addresses, @{product} will cycle through them in the order returned. For optimal performance, consider enabling this setting for non-load balanced destinations.
